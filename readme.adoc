= Phaser Game 1

== Idea :
Idle TD with basic upgrades and score counter.


== Actor Stats - V1

for each "counter"
- base # flat1		| initial damage
- base # flat2 		| added / reduced
- base % multi1 	| increased / decreased
- base % multi2 	| more / less

- modifiers [] 		| array of modifiers to apply
modifiers {
	flat : []
	multi1 : []
	multi2 : []
}
== Actor Stats V2 (ToDo , Plan WIP)
Should be renamed to NumberModifiers then have recursive classes or StatsContainer class utilising NumberModifiers ???

-
- Base + Base flat & multi modifiers
- Base Min & Max + Min & Max flat & Multi Modifiers + Min & Max soft and hard caps.
- Base AdvancedModifiers??? that accepts a function callback for advanced calculation formulas .


- Total + Total flat & multi modifiers
